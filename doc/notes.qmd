## Notes

ctrl + shift + p = command palette til fx at finde styler

If you wanted to run [styler](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) on all
the files, we can use:styler::style_dir() styler::style_dir()

use the Palette (Ctrl-Shift-PCtrl-Shift-P, then type “style file”) to
style the file or

```{r}
styler:::style_active_file()
```

To check if anything has changed in the targets pipeline objects, run:

```{r}
targets::tar_outdated()
```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).
